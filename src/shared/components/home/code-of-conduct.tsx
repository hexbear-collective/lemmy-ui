                always open to feedback and suggestions, but if we notice
                someone that constantly posts / comments about how much they
                dislike everything then it&#39;s probably better for them to
                find somewhere else to spend their time. The rest of the

                - Problems tend to get bigger over time until we receive a flood

                toxic things for months or days on end. We cannot see

                Lying about moderator interactions (eg saying you were banned or
                warned for no reason when you were really banned for
                sectarianism) damages trust in the moderators and makes it less
                likely that others will come forward with reports about other
                users, allowing wreckers to fly under the radar and making the
                site less safe for everyone. Lying about moderator interactions,
                in any capacity, will lead to a permanent ban without warning.

              These are the policies for upholding our community&#39;s standards
              of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please
              contact the Hexbear moderation team and/or report the content.

                Remarks that violate the Hexbear standards of conduct, including
                hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not
                allowed.

                Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in
                the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.

              <li>
                {" "}
                Moderators may first respond to such remarks by removing the
                offending content. If the content is bad enough, the moderate
                might immediately ban.
              </li>
              <li> If the warning is unheeded, the user may be banned. </li>
              <li>
                For bans and content removal, a mod may optionally leave a
                reasoning for why in the mod log. This is encouraged, but not
                required, particularly during spam brigades.

                If the user comes back under a new account and continues to make

                Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if
                it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a
                genuine apology.

                Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community
                members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they
                should expect less leeway than others.

                Egregious violations of our code of conduct or terms of service
                will result in an immediate ban.
              </li>
              <li>
                Moderators of individual communities may have further rules in
                addition to this code of conduct. If those rules are more
                restrictive, they should be respected in that comm and its mods
                have every right to enforce them.

              Tips for how to respond to moderation
            </h3>
            <p>
              If a mod has to take action on your post or comment, take their
              advice, quit doing the thing, and get on with your life. Do not:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Carry on doing the same thing but in a slightly different way
                and then complain about how the rules aren&#39;t specific
                enough;
              </li>
              <li>
                Prattle on endlessly to other users about The Injustice Of It
                All;
              </li>
              <li>
                Grumble passive-aggressively about how you&#39;re no longer
                allowed to send people vore in the megathread;
              </li>
              <li>
                Try to rope the mod into a lengthy discussion about your
                interpretation of the rules, or how RandomUser once did the same
                thing that SomeGuy&#39;s done twenty times and RandomUser never
                got banned for it but they banned SomeGuy after the 19th time,
                etc;
              </li>
              <li>
                Something to remember: the full details of mod interventions are
                often not public information, and in the above scenario,
                it&#39;s extremely unlikely you would have known whether or not
                RandomUser was banned for the reason you think either way. We
                try to give as much context as possible in the mod log, but
                it&#39;s not always possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mods are not obligated to justify bans and build a
                &#34;case&#34; explaining the reasoning for a ban.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In the Hexbear community we strive to go the extra step to look
              out for each other. Don&#39;t just aim to be technically
              unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid
              flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if
              they&#39;re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary
              fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive
              people away from the community entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
              If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the
              urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained
              about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or
              unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you
              could&#39;ve communicated better --- remember that it&#39;s your
              responsibility to make others comfortable. Everyone wants to get
              along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to
              shitpost in a leftist community. You will find that people will be
              eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their
              trust.
