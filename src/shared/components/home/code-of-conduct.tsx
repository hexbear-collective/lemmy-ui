                We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming 
                environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression,
                sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, 
                ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

            <h4 id="user-content-palestine">Palestine, and zionism:</h4>
            <p>
                "Israel", the zionist entity, is an explicitly settler-colonial 
                genocidal ethnonationalist project, predicated on the dispossession 
                and murder of the native Palestinians.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary mode of discrimination within the entity is Jewish 
                supremacy, and it is supported by the global forces of capitalism, 
                imperialism, and white supremacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help maintain support domestically and abroad, the entity falsely 
                claims to represent and protect all Jews.
            </p>

            <h4 id="user-content-imperialism">Anti-Imperalism, AES, and Critical Support:</h4>
            <p>
                We generally oppose wars supported by the so-called "west", because 
                they serve to maintain the global hierarchy that keeps countries 
                outside the imperial core weak and easily exploitable.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Critical Support" means that while we may not agree with every policy 
                of a country that is being targeted by the US Empire, we support them in 
                their struggle to remain independent.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not condemn countries that have achieved Actually Existing 
                Socialism for not 100% matching purist ideals about what "socialism" 
                looks like in theory.  We recognize that socialism is a process, not 
                a destination.

            <h4 id="user-content-covid">COVID:</h4>
            <p>
                Considering immunocompromized or otherwise vulnerable comrades 
                expendable is eugenics. Refusing to acknowledge the harm COVID 
                has done and continues to do plays into the hand of fascists. An 
                inability to see who is and has been most harmed by COVID is a 
                failure in basic solidarity and humanity. Most of all, COVID is a 
                working class issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't debate people about masking/vaccines on Hexbear. Anti-vax or 
                anti-mask attitudes are not welcome on Hexbear as the science on this 
                is clear.  Staying aware of and protecting yourself and others from 
                covid is an act of solidarity.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h4 id="user-content-veganism">Veganism:</h4>
            <p>
                Animal liberation is essential to any socialist movement. Users 
                should not be anti-vegan, although we do not require users to be vegan.

                or directly before the following topics or depictions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Self-Harm including medically assisted procedures</li>
                <li>Suicide/Suicidal Ideation</li>
                <li>Violence towards humans or animals including corpses or gore. 
                    This includes animal corpses used as food, animal products, 
                    and animal abuse.</li>
                <li>Traumatic societal harms such as Transphobia, Sexism, Gender

            <p>
                Triggering content should be placed inside a spoiler tag. Post 
                images that depict triggering content should be marked NSFW. 
                Post titles should contain warnings at the beginning. Use 
                established abbreviations where possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Failure to use content warnings properly can result in your post 
                being removed and/or further moderator action.

            <h3 id="user-content-tone-indicators">Tone Indicators</h3>
            <p>
                Users should work to introduce the use of tone indicators into 
                their posts and comments. Place tone indicators at the end of the 
                relevant content.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no punishment for failing to use tone indicators. 
                However it is a helpful practice for neurodivergent comrades 
                and overall communication on the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some communities, like the ones that forbid low-quality posts, 
                may enforce the use of tone indicators at the discretion of the 
                respective moderator(s).
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3 id="user-content-disengage">Use of Disengage</h3>
            <p>
                Any user may disengage from any discussion by posting a two word,
                 and only two word, reply: "I'm Disengaging". Stipulations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not post a lengthy reply and then end it with "I'm 
                disengaging."</li>
                <li>Do not disengage yet continue to reply directly/indirectly to 
                the user or about the user.</li>
                <li>Do not complain when someone properly uses the feature on 
                you.</li>
                <li>Do not try to circumvent these restrictions by vague posting 
                or bringing it up later in another thread.</li>
                <li>Do not retroactively use disengage through editing posts or 
                comments. Abusing disengage, failure to abide a proper 
                disengagement, or circumventing the stipulations can result in 
                moderator action.</li>

                <li>Do not demean or harass others for caring about a topic or

                <li>Constructive engagement is more important than "dunking".</li>
                <li>Users are allowed to ask good faith questions, however there 
                is little tolerance for debate against the community statements.</li>
                <li>Users must try and take the most charitable interpretation of 
                fellow users.</li>

                Users can appeal moderator actions in 
                <a href="https://www.hexbear.net/c/hexbear">c/hexbear</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Please provide the link to the original thread or reply (if it 
                hasn't been removed), as well as any communications you received 
                from the moderator.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also post a screenshot from the modlog. The more context 
                you provide, the easier it will be for someone to action your appeal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moderators will provide additional communications, modlog 
                entries, and any discussion between moderators in response.
            </p>
            <p>
                An admin will adjudicate the appeal as soon as one is available 
                and lock posts that are resolved.  Intentionally abusing the appeal 
                process will result in a permanent site ban.
            </p>

            <h3 id="user-content-community-moderators">Community Moderators</h3>
            <p>
                Moderators have the ability to remove posts, remove comments, 
                ban users from a community, pin your comments in a post (speak 
                as moderator), pin posts in the community, lock posts in the 
                community, and change the community name &amp; details.
            </p>
            <h4 id="user-content-mod-guidelines">Mod Guidelines:</h4>
            <p>
                Every moderator action that asks for a reason (remove comments/post 
                and banning) must cite the relevant rule and verbal warnings are 
                strongly encouraged.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to acting on reports, please 
                actively moderate posts in the community when you have time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make use of warnings, either as a response or a pinned comment, 
                then remove comments/posts, escalate temp bans (1 day, 3 days, 
                1 week) and in severe cases, permanently ban users.
            </p>
            <p>
                When banning a user the purge/remove content option is to be used 
                for doxxing or extreme images (CSAM, Gore Shock Images, etc.) only.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter the content, the remove content option is entirely, 
                exclusively, ONLY for doxxing or extreme image and nothing else! 
                Using the "remove content" option inappropriately when banning 
                users will result in revoking of moderator privileges.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have questions about taking a moderator action please 
                communicate them with your fellow moderators either through 
                Hexbear direct messages or matrix.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not hesitate to let an admin know about a user who is 
                breaking the Code of Conduct in an egregious manner.
            </p>
            <h4 id="user-content-act-the-part">Act the part:</h4>
            <p>
                Remember that people often assume all posts or comments from 
                moderators are official communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your normal, non-distinguished comments carry weight!
            </p>
            <p>
                It is essential that community moderators recognize the weight 
                their moderator privilege holds.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use your moderator account you are speaking on the 
                site's behalf. What you say and the actions you take impact 
                site culture and health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be serious, grounded,  disciplined in your community moderation 
                and for any community changes, discussion must be before we 
                implement change!
            </p>

                We are a volunteer-run internet forum. We don't have many admins 
                and act off of consensus.

                The given rules in the Code of Conduct are not meant to be an
